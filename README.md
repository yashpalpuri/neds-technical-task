# neds-technical-task

Create a single page application that displays 'Next to go’ races using Neds API. A user should see 5 races at all times, and they should be sorted by time ascending. Race should disappear from the list after 1 min past the start time (advertised_start). User should see meeting name (meeting_name), race number (race_number) and
countdown timer that indicates the start of the race. User should be able to toggle race categories to view races belonging to only the selected
category.
